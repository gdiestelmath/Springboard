    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Since the data consists of two identical copies of the same set of resumes, one labelled 'b' and on 'w', and, the the race connected with each resume is assigned randomly to each employer, a natural test is a test of proportions for call-backs based on the variable race. Each of 2435 resumes appear twice, once with each race label and the number of callbacks for 'b'-resumes is 157 and for 'w'-resumes is 235. Thus, if pb is the proportion of callbacks for 'b'-resumes, 2435pb(1-pb) is much larger than 5 or 10 or any other standard size which justifies the practical use of the CLT. The same holds for the proportion pw of 'w'-callbacks as this proportion is larger. The hypotheses used to test for a difference in thes proportions are as follows.\n",

However, such a restriction of the data could mean that the use of the CLT is no longer justified. If not, there are a number of options. For example, in such cases one may use the Fisher test of association. If such a test suggests that call back rates among the best candidates are dependent on race then, in the least, this would justify further data collection in order to obtain a more powerful and statistically significant test."
